## Implementation Details

### 1. Secure Token Management System

The implemented `SecureTokenManager` provides comprehensive token security with the following features:

```javascript
// Key features of SecureTokenManager
class SecureTokenManager {
  // Encrypt tokens using AES-256-GCM
  encryptToken(token, userId, platform) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Decrypt tokens for use
  decryptToken(tokenData) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Store tokens securely
  async storeToken(token, userId, platform, metadata) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Retrieve and decrypt tokens
  async getToken(userId, platform) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Refresh tokens using platform mechanisms
  async refreshToken(userId, platform, refreshCallback) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Revoke tokens
  async revokeToken(userId, platform, revokeCallback) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Verify token validity
  async verifyToken(userId, platform, verifyCallback) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

The token management system uses AES-256-GCM encryption with unique initialization vectors and authentication tags for each token, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, the tokens remain secure.

### 2. API Rate Limiter

The `ApiRateLimiter` provides platform-specific rate limiting to prevent exceeding API quotas:

```javascript
// Key features of ApiRateLimiter
class ApiRateLimiter {
  // Check if a request can be made
  async canMakeRequest(userId, platform, endpoint) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Record a request for rate limiting
  async recordRequest(userId, platform, endpoint) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Get current rate limit status
  async getRateLimitStatus(userId, platform, endpoint) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Wait until a rate-limited request can be made
  async waitForRateLimit(userId, platform, endpoint, options) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

The rate limiter maintains platform-specific configurations for different endpoints and time windows, ensuring that Schedulo Pro respects the rate limits of each social media platform.

### 3. Bulk Upload Processor

The `BulkUploadProcessor` optimizes file uploads with chunking and concurrent processing:

```javascript
// Key features of BulkUploadProcessor
class BulkUploadProcessor {
  // Add files to the upload queue
  async addToQueue(files, userId, metadata) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Get status of a batch upload
  async getBatchStatus(batchId) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Cancel a batch upload
  async cancelBatch(batchId) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Process the upload queue
  async _processQueue() {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Upload a file using chunked upload
  async _uploadFile(task) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

The processor handles up to 90 simultaneous uploads efficiently by breaking files into chunks, processing multiple uploads concurrently, and providing detailed progress tracking.

### 4. Error Recovery System

The `ErrorRecoverySystem` provides comprehensive error handling and recovery:

```javascript
// Key features of ErrorRecoverySystem
class ErrorRecoverySystem {
  // Create a circuit breaker for a service
  createCircuitBreaker(serviceName, fn, options) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Create a retry mechanism
  createRetrier(operationName, options) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Handle an error with appropriate recovery
  async handleError(error, context) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Register custom error handlers
  registerErrorHandler(category, handler) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}

// Circuit breaker implementation
class CircuitBreaker {
  // Execute with circuit breaking
  async exec(...args) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}

// Retry with backoff implementation
class RetryWithBackoff {
  // Execute with retry
  async execute(fn, ...args) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

The error recovery system categorizes errors, applies appropriate recovery strategies, and prevents cascading failures through circuit breakers and retry mechanisms.

### 5. Automated Testing Framework

The testing framework provides comprehensive testing capabilities:

```javascript
// Key features of the testing framework
class TestSuite {
  // Add a test to the suite
  test(description, testFn, options) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Run all tests in the suite
  async run() {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}

class MockApi {
  // Add mock routes
  addRoute(method, path, handler) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Handle requests
  async handleRequest(method, path, options) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}

class TestRunner {
  // Add test suites
  addSuite(suite) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Run all test suites
  async run() {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

The framework enables comprehensive testing of all components, with mock APIs for testing integrations without real API calls and detailed reporting of test results.
