# Schedulo Pro - Requirements Analysis

## Project Overview
Schedulo Pro is a no-code web application designed for bulk scheduling (up to 90 days) and multi-account management across multiple social media platforms including Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, and Facebook. The application requires complete UI/UX design, backend functionality, API integration, security measures, and monitoring capabilities.

## Functional Requirements Analysis

### 1. User Authentication & Accounts
- **OAuth2 Integration**: Must implement OAuth2 authentication for all supported social media platforms:
  - Instagram Graph API
  - TikTok Business API
  - Twitter OAuth 2.0
  - Facebook Graph API
- **Token Security**: All access tokens must be encrypted at rest to ensure security
- **Session Management**: JWT-based session management with role-based access control (admin, editor, viewer)
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to handle token refresh, expiration, and revocation

### 2. Social Account Linking
- **Connection Flow**: Provide intuitive "Connect Account" buttons for each platform's OAuth flow
- **Token Management**: Securely store access tokens with automatic refresh capabilities
- **Account Management**: Allow users to disconnect/revoke individual accounts without affecting others
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to handle API rate limits and token validation

### 3. Bulk Upload & Storage
- **Media Handling**: Support drag-and-drop functionality for up to 90 video files simultaneously
- **Metadata Management**: Provide input fields for caption, hashtags, cover thumbnail, and target platforms
- **Storage Solution**: Store media in a CDN (Cloudinary or Uploadcare) and metadata in a database (Airtable)
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to handle large file uploads, progress tracking, and error handling

### 4. Scheduling Engine
- **Serverless Architecture**: Implement a serverless scheduler using Make.com or Xano cron jobs
- **Timezone Support**: Full timezone support per user to ensure accurate scheduling
- **Reliability**: Implement retry logic with exponential back-off for failed posting attempts
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to handle scheduling conflicts and prioritization

### 5. Multi-Platform Posting
- **API Integration**: Trigger appropriate API calls for each platform at scheduled times
- **Batch Processing**: Implement batch API calls with rate-limit handling
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of successes and failures in the database
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to handle platform-specific requirements and limitations

### 6. Calendar & Dashboard
- **Calendar Integration**: Embed FullCalendar.js for month/week/day views
- **Interactive UI**: Support drag-and-drop for rescheduling and click-to-edit functionality
- **Filtering**: Implement filters for platform, account, and status (Scheduled, Posted, Failed)
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to ensure real-time updates and synchronization

### 7. Analytics & Logs
- **Metrics Collection**: Daily jobs to fetch post metrics (likes, views, comments) from each platform
- **Data Visualization**: Store metrics in database and display charts in the dashboard
- **Error Handling**: Capture and display error logs with admin notifications via Slack or email
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to handle API limitations and data aggregation

### 8. Security & Compliance
- **Data Protection**: TLS encryption for data in transit; GDPR-compliant consent during signup
- **API Security**: Rate-limiting for API calls and monitoring of usage quotas
- **Audit Trail**: Regular auditing of stored tokens and data access logs
- **Implementation Considerations**: Need to implement proper security headers and vulnerability scanning

## UI/UX Specification Analysis

### Global Styles
- **Typography**: Inter for body text, Space Grotesk for headers
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: Indigo 500 (#6366F1)
  - Secondary: Orange 500 (#F97316)
  - Neutrals: Gray 100/900
  - Status: Success #10B981, Error #EF4444
- **Spacing**: 8px base grid (p-2, p-4, p-6)
- **Border Radius**: 2xl on cards and buttons for a modern look

### Layout Components
1. **Sidebar (Sticky)**:
   - Navigation with icons and labels
   - Sections: Dashboard, Calendar, Library, Accounts, Analytics, Settings
   
2. **Topbar**:
   - Search functionality
   - Notification center
   - Profile menu with "Connect Account" CTA
   
3. **Main View**:
   - Card grid or calendar embed based on current route
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Interactions & Animations
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Column animations with spring physics using Framer Motion
- **Button Interactions**: Scale 1.05 with subtle glow on hover
- **Success Feedback**: Toast notification with green check and confetti burst
- **Error Feedback**: Shake animation with red inline message

### Key Screens
1. **Login/Signup**:
   - Social OAuth buttons for authentication
   - Clean, minimal design

2. **Onboarding Wizard**:
   - Step-by-step process to connect first social account
   - Timezone selection
   - Default posting rules configuration

3. **Bulk Upload**:
   - Drag-and-drop zone for media files
   - Metadata form for content details
   - Preview thumbnails for uploaded content

4. **Calendar View**:
   - Platform filter toggles
   - Drag-to-reschedule functionality
   - Click-to-edit post details

5. **Accounts Management**:
   - List of connected accounts
   - "+ Connect" button for adding new accounts
   - Status indicators for each connection

6. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Line/bar charts showing posts vs. engagements
   - Filterable by platform and date range

## No-Code Tech Stack Requirements

The application requires solutions for:

1. **Frontend/UI**: No-code platform for building the user interface
2. **Storage & DB**: Database solution for storing user data, schedules, and metadata
3. **Automation & Scheduler**: Tool for handling scheduled posts and automation workflows
4. **Media CDN**: Content delivery network for storing and serving media files
5. **Auth**: Authentication and authorization solution
6. **Monitoring**: Tools for monitoring application performance and errors

## Acceptance Criteria Analysis

1. **Account Connect**:
   - Users must be able to link and unlink each platform
   - Revoked tokens must automatically refresh
   - Testing needed for connection stability

2. **Bulk Upload**:
   - System must accept up to 90 files simultaneously
   - Progress indicators must be accurate
   - Metadata must be stored correctly in the database

3. **Schedule Execution**:
   - Posts must appear on platforms at the correct local time
   - Testing required across three different timezones
   - Verification of content integrity

4. **Calendar Functionality**:
   - Calendar must accurately reflect database state
   - Drag events must properly update the schedule
   - UI must be responsive and intuitive

5. **Analytics**:
   - Data must refresh daily
   - Error logs must be visible in Settings
   - Metrics must be accurate and properly visualized

## Key Challenges and Considerations

1. **API Integration Complexity**: Each social platform has unique API requirements and limitations
2. **Media Processing**: Handling large video files efficiently across platforms
3. **Scheduling Reliability**: Ensuring posts are published at exact scheduled times
4. **Token Management**: Securely storing and refreshing OAuth tokens
5. **Performance**: Maintaining responsiveness with potentially large datasets
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and recovery mechanisms
