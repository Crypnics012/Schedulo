# Schedulo Pro Implementation Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for building Schedulo Pro using no-code tools. The plan is structured to guide the development process from initial setup to final deployment, ensuring all functional requirements are met.

## System Architecture Overview

Schedulo Pro will be built using the following no-code tools:

1. **Frontend/UI**: Bubble.io
2. **Database**: Airtable
3. **Automation & Scheduler**: Make (formerly Integromat)
4. **Media CDN**: Cloudinary
5. **Authentication**: Auth0
6. **Monitoring**: Datadog

## Implementation Phases

The implementation will be divided into the following phases:

1. **Setup & Configuration**: Set up all accounts and configure the basic infrastructure
2. **Database Design**: Create the data model in Airtable
3. **Authentication Implementation**: Configure Auth0 and integrate with Bubble
4. **Frontend Development**: Build the UI in Bubble following the mockups
5. **Social Media API Integration**: Connect to each platform's API
6. **Scheduling Engine Implementation**: Build the scheduling workflows in Make
7. **Media Management**: Configure Cloudinary and integrate with Bubble
8. **Analytics & Monitoring**: Set up analytics dashboards and monitoring
9. **Testing & Optimization**: Test all functionality and optimize performance
10. **Deployment & Documentation**: Deploy the final solution and document the system

Each phase includes detailed steps, estimated time for completion, and dependencies on other phases.
